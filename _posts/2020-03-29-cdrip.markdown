# Setup

Ubuntu with 3 CDROM drives: /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 and /dev/sr2. 

Install ripit
``` bash
sudo apt install ripit
``` 

Script to handle one CDROM drive ... it will:

  1. Wait for CD inserted
  2. Rip the CD to "Music/$artist/$year ‐ $album/$nr. $song" and store both flac and mp3 files.
  3. Eject the CD
  4. Go to 1.

If the CD is already ripped, it will just eject it.
If parts of the CD is already ripped, it will just continue.
If the CD is unknown, it will rip it to Unknown. The next Unkown CD will go much faster.

I genereally pile CD's thats is ejected to fast, for later manuel handling ... out of 650 CD's I had to process 10 manually.

``` bash
DEVICE=/dev/sr0
while true ; do
  while cddbget -c ${DEVICE} -I | grep "fatal error" ; do sleep 5 ; done # We need this, else ripit access the wrong CDROM driver?!
  ripit -d ${DEVICE} -c 0,2 -q 5,8 -W NTFS  --resume --loop 0 -e --nointeraction -O y --dirtemplate '"Music/$artist/$year ‐ $album"' -Z
  sleep 1
done
```

Run 3 instance of the program, from tmux (if you connect to the server with ssh)

# Misc

Convert many files to a new format, here from mp3 to ogg

``` bash
parallel --eta ffmpeg -i "{}" -map_metadata 0:s:0 -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 "{.}.mp3" ::: */*/*.ogg
```

It's better to convert from Flac as it's lossless audio compression.
