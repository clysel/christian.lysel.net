<h2>Battlefield 2</h2><br />
Battlefield 2 is a first-person shooter with some strategy and RPG elements.</p>
<p>A demo is available for download from major game sites featuring a single map (Gulf of Oman) for both single-player and multi-player. The 16-person version of the map has a time limit of 10 minutes; the 32-person version has a time limit of 12 minutes. The 64-person version is unavailable in the demo, though up to 64 players can still play on the 32-person map. EA Games shut down all of its demo servers on November 28, 2005. However, demo client and demo server software are still available for download from BF2 website should players and server operators wish to host the game themselves.</p>
<p>Some aspects of gameplay, such as jet combat, are markedly different in the demo compared with the current game. This is due to changes made in recent patches. The demo does not feature rankings, apart from on a couple of servers.</p>
